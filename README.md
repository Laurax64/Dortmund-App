# Dortmund App

To practice the concepts I learned in unit 4 of [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course), including 
app architecture and how to use ViewModels, UI State, and StateFlow to build more complex apps, how to use the Navigation component to build more complex apps with more screens and how to navigate and pass data between different composables, how to adapt your app to different screen sizes and provide a better user experience, as well as how to test your adaptive UI, I build this app that that displays recommendations for things to do and places to visit within Dortmund.
