# Dortmund App

To practice the concepts I learned in unit 4 of [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course), including 
app architecture, ViewModels, UI State, StateFlow, navigation component, multiple screens, how to navigate and pass data between different composables, adapt to different screen sizes, test adaptive UI, I build this Android app that that displays recommendations for things to do and places to visit within Dortmund.
